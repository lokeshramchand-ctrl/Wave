Perfect — thanks for sharing both the folder structure screenshot and your current README draft. Right now your README is already solid, but I can help you refine it to look professional, structured, and attractive for open-source contributors. I'll also suggest improvements (like adding a banner, badges, and better project structure visualization).


Here’s a refined README template (super neat, no emojis, feels like an OSS-level project):

✅ Suggestion: Consider adding a banner image (assets/images/banner.png) for your README (a wide 1200x400 graphic with app name + tagline). This gives a professional OSS look when someone lands on your repo.

🔥 Suggestions to improve your repo presentation




Banner Image: A simple minimalist banner (with app name & wave-style graphic).




Badges: Add GitHub badges at the top (build passing, MIT license, contributions welcome).




Screenshots / GIFs: Show the app in action (before/after light & dark mode).




Wiki/Docs folder: If you expand features, link docs for dev setup and database schema.





👉 Do you want me to design a clean banner mockup (like a minimal wave graphic with the app name) for your repo so it looks next-level on GitHub?
